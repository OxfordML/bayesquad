    """Return the jacobian of a kernel evaluated at all pairs from two sets of points.

    Given a kernel and two sets :math:`X, D` of points (`variable_points` and `fixed_points` respectively), this
    function will evaluate the jacobian of the kernel at each pair of points :math:`(x, d)` with :math:`x \in X` and
    :math:`d \in D`. The derivative is taken with respect to the first argument, i.e. :math:`d` is regarded as a
    fixed quantity. Typically, :math:`D` will be the set of :math:`x` values in the data set of a Gaussian Process, and
    :math:`X` will be the set of :math:`x` values at which we wish to find the gradient of the posterior GP.

    Parameters
    ----------
    kernel
        The kernel to be differentiated. Currently supported kernels are:

    variable_points
        A 2D array of points, with shape (num_variable_points, num_dimensions).
    fixed_points
        A 2D array of points, with shape (num_fixed_points, num_dimensions).

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        A 3D array of shape (num_variable_points, num_fixed_points, num_dimensions), whose (i, j, k)-th element is the
        k-th component of the jacobian of the kernel evaluated at the i-th point of :math:`X` and the j-th point of
        :math:`D`.

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If the provided kernel type is not supported. See the parameters list for a list of supported kernels.

    variable_points

    Returns
    -------
